# Doctor-s-Office-System
My part from my group project to develop a desktop application for a doctor's office. I developed the GUI for nurses.
I used Java for the back end and JavaFX for the GUI.
The nurse would search for a patient or enter a new one.
The nurse would also be able to view and update a patient's allergy information.
